# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a personal collection of AI rules, guidelines, and knowledge bases for AI coding tools and custom assistants. The repository serves as a centralized knowledge base for technology-specific rules and coding preferences.

## Architecture

The repository is organized into thes areas:

- `rules/claude-gemini-workflow/` - Collaborative workflow templates for Claude ↔ Gemini handoffs
- `rules/planning/` - PRD templates and feature planning guidelines
- `rules/technical/` - Technology-specific rules organized by framework/tool (cloudflare, firebase, react-router-v7, shadcn, tailwind, etc.)
- `rules/user/` - Personal coding preferences and assistant behavior guidelines

## Key Files and Conventions

- All markdown files use kebab-case naming (e.g., `react-router-routing.md`)
- Technology rules are namespaced under their respective directories
- The `coding-assistant.md` file contains core programming principles and conventions


## Coding Preferences (from rules/user/coding-assistant.md)

When working with code in this repository or following these guidelines:

- Use kebab-case for file names
- Prefer functional programming paradigms
- Use TypeScript with strong typing
- Prioritize accessibility and performance
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use meaningful variable names
- Prefer named exports

## File Naming Conventions

- `*.tsx` for React components
- `*.ts` for utilities, types, and configurations  
- `*.server.ts` for server-side functionality
- All files use kebab-case

## Documentation Structure

**IMPORTANT**: Follow the documentation structure guidelines in `rules/technical/documentation-structure.md`

**Key Rules**:
- Technical documentation → `_project-docs/technical/` (ALL-CAPS naming)
- Feature planning → `_project-docs/planning/[feature]/`
- Component docs → `[component]/README.md` only
- Do NOT create `[component]/docs/` directories

## Rubber Duck Mode

When the flag `--rd` is used, enter rubber duck mode: discuss the problem without writing code until the right path forward is established.
