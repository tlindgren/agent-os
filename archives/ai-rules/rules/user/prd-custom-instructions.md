Generate a comprehensive, structured, and actionable Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format. This PRD should serve as a detailed action plan based on a review of a provided project proposal (which may include code, descriptions, requirements), relevant documentation (e.g., protocol specs, SDK docs), and optionally, comparison examples (e.g., existing implementations).

## PROCESS:

1.  **Analyze Inputs:** Thoroughly review all provided materials (proposal, code snippets, documentation, examples).
2.  **Identify Discrepancies & Opportunities:** Pinpoint critical bugs, architectural flaws, security vulnerabilities, missing functionality, areas for improvement, deviations from best practices or documentation, and opportunities inspired by examples.
3.  **Structure Recommendations:** Organize the findings into a clear, prioritized action plan following the specified output format.
4.  **Justify & Guide:** For each recommendation, provide clear reasoning and concrete implementation guidance.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (PRD Structure):

You MUST structure the output as follows:

1.  **Overall Goal:** Start with a concise H2 heading (`## PRD: [Project Name] Enhancements`) followed by a brief statement defining the overall objective of the proposed changes.
2.  **Categorization:** Group all recommendations into the following H3 sections (`### [Category Name]`), presented in this order:
    - `Critical Fixes & Core Stability`: Essential changes to fix bugs, security issues, or major architectural problems.
    - `Core Functionality Enhancements`: Improvements or necessary additions to the primary features outlined in the proposal.
    - `Advanced Features & New Capabilities`: Suggestions for new features or significant extensions beyond the original scope.
    - `Non-Functional Requirements & Best Practices`: Recommendations related to code quality, security hardening, configuration, logging, testing, packaging, documentation, and adherence to standards/protocols.
3.  **Actionable Items (Checklist):** Present each specific recommendation as a Markdown checklist item (`*   [ ] [Item Number]. [Action Title]:`).
4.  **Detailed Item Structure:** For EACH checklist item, you MUST include the following clearly labeled sub-points:
    - `**Action:**`: A clear, concise, verb-oriented statement of _what_ needs to be done.
    - `**Rationale:**`: A detailed explanation of _why_ this action is needed. Reference specific issues found in the review, best practices, documentation guidelines, or patterns from examples. Justify the importance or benefit of the change.
    - `**Implementation:**`: Concrete suggestions on _how_ the action could be implemented. Mention specific libraries, code patterns, design choices, API calls, or configuration changes. If there are multiple valid approaches, list them as options.

## GUIDELINES & BEST PRACTICES FOR GENERATION:

- **Be Specific & Actionable:** Avoid vague recommendations. Each "Action" should be a clear task.
- **Prioritize Ruthlessly:** Ensure the categorization accurately reflects the urgency and importance of each item (Critical > Core > Advanced > Non-Functional).
- **Justify Everything:** The "Rationale" is crucial. Explain _why_ each change is recommended, linking it back to the analysis of the provided materials.
- **Provide Concrete Guidance:** The "Implementation" section should offer helpful starting points, not just restate the problem.
- **Reference Sources:** Explicitly mention when a recommendation is based on specific documentation points or observed patterns in examples.
- **Be Comprehensive:** Cover technical debt, feature gaps, potential future enhancements, and non-functional aspects.
- **Use Markdown:** Ensure the final output is well-formatted Markdown using headings, lists, bolding, and checkboxes.
- **Ask Clarifying Questions:** If the provided materials are ambiguous or incomplete, ask for clarification before proceeding.
